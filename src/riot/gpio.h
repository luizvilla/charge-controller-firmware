 * @brief       Low-level GPIO peripheral driver
 *
 * This is a basic GPIO (General-purpose input/output) interface to allow
 * platform independent access to a MCU's input/output pins. This interface is
 * intentionally designed to be as simple as possible, to allow for easy
 * implementation and maximum portability.
 *
 * The interface provides capabilities to initialize a pin as output-,
 * input- and interrupt pin. With the API you can basically set/clear/toggle the
 * digital signal at the hardware pin when in output mode. Configured as input you can
 * read a digital value that is being applied to the pin externally. When initializing
 * an external interrupt pin, you can register a callback function that is executed
 * in interrupt context once the interrupt condition applies to the pin. Usually you
 * can react to rising or falling signal flanks (or both).
 *
 * In addition the API provides to set standard input/output circuit modes such as
 * e.g. internal push-pull configurations.
 *
 * All modern micro controllers organize their GPIOs in some form of ports,
 * often named 'PA', 'PB', 'PC'..., or 'P0', 'P1', 'P2'..., or similar. Each of
 * these ports is then assigned a number of pins, often 8, 16, or 32. A hardware
 * pin can thus be described by its port/pin tuple. To access a pin, the
 * @p GPIO_PIN(port, pin) macro should be used. For example: If your platform has
 * a pin PB22, it will be port=1 and pin=22. The @p GPIO_PIN macro should be
 * overridden by a MCU, to allow for efficient encoding of the the port/pin tuple.
 * For example, on many platforms it is possible to `OR` the pin number with the
 * corresponding ports base register address. This allows for efficient decoding
 * of pin number and base address without the need of any address lookup.
 *
 * In case the driver does not define it, the below macro definition is used to
 * simply map the port/pin tuple to the pin value. In that case, predefined GPIO
 * definitions in `RIOT/boards/ * /include/periph_conf.h` will define the selected
 * GPIO pin.
 *
 * @warning The scalar GPIO pin type `gpio_t` is deprecated and will be
 * replaced by a structured GPIO pin type in a future GPIO API. Therefore,
 * don't use the direct comparison of GPIO pins anymore. Instead, use the
 * inline comparison functions @ref gpio_is_equal and @ref gpio_is_valid.
 *
 * # (Low-) Power Implications
 *
 * On almost all platforms, we can only control the peripheral power state of
 * full ports (i.e. groups of pins), but not for single GPIO pins. Together with
 * CPU specific alternate function handling for pins used by other peripheral
 * drivers, this can make it quite complex to keep track of pins that are
 * currently used at a certain moment. To simplify the implementations (and ease
 * the memory consumption), we expect ports to be powered on (e.g. through
 * peripheral clock gating) when first used and never be powered off again.
 *
 * GPIO driver implementations **should** power on the corresponding port during
 * gpio_init() and gpio_init_int().
 *
 * For external interrupts to work, some platforms may need to block certain
 * power modes (although this is not very likely). This should be done during
 * gpio_init_int().
